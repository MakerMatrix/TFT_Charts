*TFT Charting library for AVRs and other microcontrollers
This library provides a class and methods to produce an XY chart from raw data, rendering it to an SPI display.  It was developed for the ILI9341 but will probably work with any display that supports the Adafruit GFX library, by simply replacing the ILI9341 LCD driver with the one for your model.

Documentation to come later...make an issue if you have questions in the meantime.
